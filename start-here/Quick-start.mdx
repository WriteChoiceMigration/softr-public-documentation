## Some basic **concepts**

Softr's core concept is the **building** **block**. You have the freedom of arranging the blocks in any order, grouping them into **pages,** and defining a particular set of links and relationships within your **application** as well as with external parties.

Those data sources are powerful tools used by thousands of users around the world.

## Workspaces

After logging into your Softr account, you'll be taken to one of your [workspaces](https://www.notion.so/Workspaces-and-Applications-a10324b25edf4b79b7fd8daef5ea0794?pvs=21). You organize all your Softr applications into workspace and can invite others to collaborate with you within a workspace or on a specific app

## **Studio**

The Studio is your workspace where you design and build your app. Let's check how the navigation is organized here.

In the **left toolbar,** you can access [Pages, Blocks](https://www.notion.so/97425386980f42deaf4a77dd07b346a9?pvs=21), [Users](https://www.notion.so/Users-Menu-266193ad96e94d98b955521d1b33a704?pvs=21), as well as the app Settings.

On the left-hand side of the **top navigation bar**, you see the page you're currently editing and its path. In the center, you have the option to switch to tablet or mobile views to see what your page would look like on smaller screens. In the upper right corner, you have the **Preview** button, which can be used to preview your app at any moment, and the [Publish](https://www.notion.so/Publishing-Your-Softr-App-806009ab480c4180877f21c81857fa8e?pvs=21) button.

Please, note that on all the pages you have the **live chat button** in the bottom left corner, which you can use to get in touch with us whenever you have a question, complaint, or suggestion.
