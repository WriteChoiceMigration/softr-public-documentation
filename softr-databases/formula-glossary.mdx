Formula fields in Softr allow you to perform calculations, manipulate text, work with dates, and create conditional logic to enhance your Database's functionality. Each function is listed with its syntax and an example to demonstrate its use.

## **Introduction to Formula Fields**

Formula fields in Softr are a powerful field type that enable you to compute values based on other fields in your Database. You can add a formula field to a table like any other field type, then write a formula to generate outputs such as numbers, dates, or text strings. These fields automatically update when referenced data changes, making them ideal for dynamic calculations and data manipulation.

### To create a formula field:

1. Add a new field to your table in Softr.

2. Select "Formula" as the field type.

3. Enter the formula in the formula editor, referencing other fields and using the functions below.

4. Configure the output format (e.g., number, date, or string) under the Formatting tab.

### Formula Syntax

* When referencing other fields inside a formula, always put them in curly brackets, like so: `{Contact Name}` or `{Status}`

* When you use a function, the function only applies to what is inside the parentheses `()`. If you need to place functions inside other functions, you can use multiple parentheses, like so:  
```plain
SUM({Price}, ({Price}*{Tax Rate}))
```

* Static, text based values always need to be inside quotation marks `“` like so: 
```plain
IF({Rating}<=3, "At Risk", "Nominal")
```

* Arrays (lists of items) are always displayed inside square brackets `[]`

## **Formula Functions and Operators**

### **Text Functions**

**`CONCATENATE(text1, text2, ...)`**

Combines multiple text strings into a single string.

**Example:**

```plain
CONCATENATE({First Name}, " ", {Last Name})
```

If First Name is "Jane" and Last Name is "Doe", the result is "Jane Doe".

Alternative, you can also use the ampersand symbol `&` to combine text together, like so:

```plain
{First Name} & {Last Name}
```

---

**`LEFT(string, howMany)`**

Extracts a specified number of characters from the start of a string.

**Example:**

```plain
LEFT({Project Name}, 3)
```

If Project Name is "Website Redesign", the result is "Web".

---

**`RIGHT(string, howMany)`**

Extracts a specified number of characters from the end of a string.

**Example:**

```plain
RIGHT({Product Code}, 4)
```

If Product Code is "ITEM-1234", the result is "1234".

---

**`LEN(string)`**

Returns the length of a string in characters, including symbols and spaces.

**Example:**

```plain
LEN({Description})
```

If Description is "Softr is awesome", the result is 16.

---

**`FIND(search_text, within_text, [start_position])`**

Locates the position of a substring within a string. Returns 0 if not found.

**Example:**

```plain
FIND("Softr", {App Name})
```

If App Name is "Build with Softr", the result is 12.

---

**`SEARCH(search_text, within_text, [start_position])`**

Similar to FIND, but case-insensitive. Returns 0 if not found.

**Example:**

```plain
SEARCH("softr", {App Name})
```

If App Name is "Build with SOFTR", the result is 12.

---

**`SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])`**

## **Tips for Writing Formulas**

* **Plan Ahead**: Before writing a formula, outline your goal in plain language (e.g., "Calculate the days remaining until a deadline").

* **Check Syntax**: Softr's formula editor highlights errors. Ensure field names are correct and enclosed in curly braces {}.

* **Use Nesting**: Combine functions for complex logic, such as nested IF statements: 
```plain
IF({Score} > 90, "A", IF({Score} > 80, "B", "C"))
```

* **Format Outputs**: Use the Formatting tab to set the desired output format (e.g., decimal places for numbers, date styles for dates).

* **Test Thoroughly**: Preview your formula results in Softr to confirm they behave as expected.

## **Common Use Cases**

* **Dynamic Text**: Combine names or create custom labels:Result: "New York - USA" 
```plain
CONCATENATE({City}, " - ", {Country})
```

* **Conditional Logic**: Categorize records based on criteria:Result: "High" or "Low" 
```plain
IF({Revenue} > 10000, "High", "Low")
```

* **Date Calculations**: Track project timelines:Result: Number of days until the due date 
```plain
DATETIME_DIFF({Due Date}, TODAY(), "days")
```

* **Numeric Calculations**: Compute totals or percentages:Result: 10% of Price, rounded to two decimals 
```plain
ROUND({Price} * 0.1, 2)
```

## **Limitations**

* Formula fields are read-only and cannot be manually edited.

* Complex formulas may impact performance in large Databases.

* Some functions (e.g., FIND vs. SEARCH) are case-sensitive; choose the appropriate function for your needs.

* Ensure referenced fields exist and contain valid data to avoid errors.
