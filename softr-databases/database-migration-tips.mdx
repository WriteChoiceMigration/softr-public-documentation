Migrating to Softr databases comes with a lot of benefits, but whenever you’re moving your data to a new place, you need to be fully aware of everything involved. That’s why we put this check list together - to help you learn if migrating to Softr Database is good for you, before doing so. So let’s dive into the do’s and dont’s!

## **✅ To Know Ahead of Time**

* **Duplicate your data and app**
  + Make a duplicate base of your Airtable data.
  + Make a duplicate Softr app to test the migration.

* **Handle lookup & rollup fields carefully**
  + If you use many Lookup or Rollup fields, put them in a separate view in your duplicate Airtable base.
  + Confirm they are working as intended post migration

* **Plan for Airtable “native” fields**
  + Created Time, Created By, Record ID, and some formulas won’t transfer—be ready to recreate them in Softr DB.
  + Update any formulas using these fields (e.g., CREATED_TIME, LAST_MODIFIED_BY).

* **Rollups, Counts, Rich Text, and Formulas**
  + Count fields need to be rebuilt in Softr DB.
  + Rich Text fields transfer as Markdown.
  + Double-check formulas—some may not be supported.

## **🛠️️ To Do After Migrating**

### **1. Re-map Your Data**

* Swap your data source to Softr DB under **Source** in the studio.

* Data fields won’t always re-map correctly—compare with your live app and re-map fields in your duplicate app.

* Update:
  + Conditional Filters in blocks
  + Search parameters and filter settings
  + Tag colors (if using “as defined in Data source”)

* Action buttons will stay connected, but fields may reset—review them carefully.

### **2. Update User Settings**

* **User Sync Table**: Toggle off “Send User Notification email” during setup.

* **User Groups**: Re-map conditional logic settings. Note: user groups may not sync until you publish.

* **Global Data Restrictions**: Recreate them from scratch—these don’t carry over automatically.

### **3. Review Visibility Permissions**

* If you’ve reconfigured User Groups, your page and block permissions should stay intact. Still, test carefully.
