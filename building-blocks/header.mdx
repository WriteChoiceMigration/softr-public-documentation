The header area of the site is usually used to display the navigation bar, logo, signin/signup , and can include other functionality depending on the nature of the site. Softr has several header layouts with different types of links and buttons that can be customized according to your requirements.

# Common Header Features

## Logo

All the Header block layouts have a **Logo** field that can be removed or changed by clicking on it. You can upload an image or choose one from the library.

## Buttons and links

Apart from the logo, there are **Buttons** and **Links**, which can also have **Sublinks** that appear within a dropdown opened when hovering over or clicking the link. Each layout has certain links and buttons by default, but you can add as many as you wish.
<Frame caption="Links and sublinks">![Links and sublinks](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F18dc862d-8a55-4cbe-a3af-79d0e68622b5%2Flinks-sublinks.png&blockId=2f6e325f-9a0c-4ed0-b6d7-dd69fc37c001&projectId=1032)</Frame>

The links have a text area to enter the link name and an **Add action** button to specify what the link does. The action can be set to **Open Page, Scroll to section**, **Open external url,** or **Sign out**
<Frame caption="Link actions">![Link actions](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1135d977-3397-4f2b-9e17-db156897f7a6%2Flink-actions.png&blockId=06589f5d-eded-4828-bc1e-b37a8bd3f055&projectId=1032)</Frame>

A **Sublink** can be added to the link by clicking the **Add sublink** option.

After adding a **Sublink**, the **Add action** option of the link becomes unavailable, as its only action now is to display the sublinks. Sublinks are configured similar to Links.

**Buttons** have a configuration similar to that of **Links**. The only difference is the visual layout.

## Show User Profile

This option is typically used to show a user profile icon with a dropdown to logged-in users. By default, you have the **Sign Out** and **My Profile** links, but you can add as many additional options as needed as well as remove the default ones.
<Frame caption="Show user profile">![Show user profile](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe22291d0-6b6f-4e89-a841-e7aa0417a777%2Fshow-user-profile.png&blockId=79277c80-ae8d-41f5-a784-48df988b1dcb&projectId=1032)</Frame>

You can see how this option is applied in [this tutorial](/11ba304436ed4354a8669d4869624b9c) on setting up Memberships.

## Sticky Header

Lastly, there is the **Always show the header on top of the screen** option. When enabled, the header will become sticky and will stay on the screen when scrolling down.
