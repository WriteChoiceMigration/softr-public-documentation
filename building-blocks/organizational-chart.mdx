<Note>Organizational chart block is available for users on the [Business plan and above](https://www.softr.io/pricing).</Note>

The Organizational Chart block is used to represent a hierarchical relationship between a group of items. The most common use case is mapping relationships between organization employees to present the whole organization hierarchy visually. So, let's see how the block is configured.

## Linking to a data source

The data for the chart is fetched from a [data source](/4230abecf813402aa2926466c313290a), so, first of all, we need to link the data source where our Organizational Chart data is located. This works the same way as for the [Bar Chart](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/type-bar-chart/hs9Nn3rYv1PJFoJADwMWk6). However, prior to connecting the data source, we need to have our data ready to be mapped to. In the next section, we'll show you how to set up the data with organization employees that can later be connected to our Org Chart block.

## Setting up the data source

You can use Airtable or Google Sheets for the datasource - the setup is the same. For Google Sheets, ensure you have the first row setup as the column names. For linked fields, you’ll need to use the Softr-generated record ID to link records together. For more information using Linked Record fields in Google Sheets, please refer to the [Google Sheets](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/google-sheets/jznC9Jr3Jri224AVmHVn4a) help document.

We’re going to demonstrate the process using [Airtable](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/airtable/jHX7kfH7QvkVcELQvS3VoX) data. Below, you can see the table we've set up for our chart. It's a simple list of organization employees with such fields as **Email, Name, Position, Profpic, Department, Supervisor**. The **Supervisor** field is a really important one, as it's used to establish the relationships between the employees. Therefore, let's examine it in greater detail.

### Establishing relationships between employees

As mentioned above, the Supervisor (can be called anything) field is where you establish the hierarchical relationships between the chart nodes (organization employees in our case). It's a **Parent** relationship, so for each employee you need to select the person he/she **reports to**.

<Tip>The Supervisor field needs to be a [Linked Record](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/206452848-How-to-link-records-in-Airtable) that's linked to the **same table**, so that you are able to map your employees to other employee records in the same table.</Tip>

Below, you can observe the process of creating the Linked Record and selecting the Parent records.

<Tip>
As, you can see, we've disabled the **Allow linking to multiple records** option since the Organizational Chart block doesn't allow to define a parent relationship to more than one record.

Moreover, we've left Supervisor field **empty** for the company CEO (**top node**), as this record is not reporting to anybody and is going to be at the top of the chart.

</Tip>

Now that our Airtable data is ready, let's proceed to mapping the fields from our chart block.

If you’re using **Google Sheets**, you can use a VLOOKUP formula to pull in the Softr ID of an employee’s manager who is stored in the same sheet. This allows the Organizational chart in Softr to lookup the user record of the employees manager and show the heirarchy appropriately. Note that this is a computed field, and is determined by the name in the Manager column.

## Mapping the chart fields

In the **Features** tab of block settings we first have the **Title** and **Subtitle** fields, which are used to add headings to the block.

Further on, there are 5 fields that we are going to map to the Airtable table we set up previously. Below you can see how that's done.

That's it. You can now publish your Softr app and present your team in a nice org chart layout.
