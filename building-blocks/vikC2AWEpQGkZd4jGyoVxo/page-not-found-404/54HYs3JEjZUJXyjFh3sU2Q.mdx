## Overview

A 404 page is a standard error message displayed by a web server when a requested webpage cannot be found. It typically appears when a user tries to access a page that has been moved, deleted, or mistyped, informing them that the resource is unavailable.

In Softr, by default we call this page “Page Not Found”, but you can change it to whatever you like. This page cannot be turned off or deleted as it provides critical navigational functionality that every website and app needs. Typically 404 pages are not indexed by search enginers.

Many companies choose to make this a fun, cheeky page to help guide users back to known website pages. To access the Page Not Found (404) page and utility block:

1. Click on the Pages menu

2. Select the Page Not Found page from the Utility pages section

3. Click anywhere on the block itself to open additional settings.
