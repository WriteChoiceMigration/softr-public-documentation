## Overview

The Signup utility page and included block allow users to signup to your app directly, with some special options for who should sign up and how. The availability of this page is determined by your [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J#sign-up) settings.

You can also create multiple signup pages by duplicating the original Signup page. This is helpful for use cases where you may need to use Hidden fields to automatically assign user groups to users who signup from various locations or for different purposes and roles.

To access the Signup page:

1. Ensure Login and Signup is enabled in [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J#sign-up)

2. Click on the Pages menu

3. Select the Signup page from the Utility pages section

4. Click anywhere on the signup page itself to open additional settings.

## Content

Click on the Content tab to open up settings about how the block needs to function.

### Logo

This section allows you to turn logo display off and on, choose square or horizontal version of your logo and also control the position of it on the signup form.

### Title and Subtitle

The Title and Subtitle are shown at the top of the signup form and can be changed to whatever you like or removed completely if needed.

### Hidden Fields

Hidden fields allow you to automatically pass information as a part of the signup without requiring the user to input anything. This is especially helpful for use cases like:

* Automatically assigning a status or role to a user that signs up

* Saving UTM parameters from the URL bar

* Saving custom tracking codes, invite codes, or affiliate codes from parameters from the URL bar

* Automatically assigning a user to company by using separate sign-up pages for each company

You can add a hidden field to the form just like anywhere else in Softr. First, ensure you are [syncing your users with a datasource](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9). Click **Add Field**, then choose the field from your user-synced data source that you want to save as a part of signup. You won’t be able to change the field type, however visible fields will be available in the future.

### Authentication Flows

Authentication flows are the methods that you want to allow your users to signup with. These are determined, again, by your User Authentication settings, but they can be hidden on any Signup page by clicking the **Eye** icon.. This is helpful for providing a signup page for a company requiring only SSO signup, while also providing a public page for only Google Sign-in, for example.

### Side Section

The Side Section allows you to change the background image and its position, heading and sub-heading and featured image or disable it completely. When disabled, the Signup form will be centered on the page. Edit and rearrange the heading, subheading, and feature image to suit your needs and brand.

### Consent Message

The Consent Message can be customized to house links to your terms, privacy policy or display any other text that the user may need to know before signing up to your app. It features a basic rich text editor for bolding, italicizing, underlining, striking, or placing hyperlinks. You can also disable this text completely if needed.

### Redirect to Login

Here you can customize the text shown to users to help redirect them to the login page if they already have an account. While you can change the text “Log in”, it will always send the users to the Log in page regardless of what you put in the blank.

### Validation Message

The validation message area allows you to customize the text that is show to the user if:

* The email they are trying to signup with is already in use.

* The email they are trying to signup with is not whitelisted by the “Domain-restricted signup” domains in the User Authentication.

### Recaptcha

Recaptcha is a service provided by Google that allows you to check the validity of the user signing up. It checks to ensure the user is a human and not a robotic web-crawler. Turning this on will require the users to complete a small verification task. Additional setup is required outside of simply toggling this on, so be sure to follow the [Recaptcha guide](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/advanced-form-features/jCim5VWZePgZuaRsUZBnpG#enable-recaptcha).

## Styles

Click on the Styles tab to change everything from background color, sizing, and rounding to surface/card colors and shadows. Other elements like text color and button color can be changed in your app’s [Theme panel](/styling/7qXYEkNvWQamR6vcLXzZnF/application-theme/91YGSL2aDJajXdbPBhitbc).
