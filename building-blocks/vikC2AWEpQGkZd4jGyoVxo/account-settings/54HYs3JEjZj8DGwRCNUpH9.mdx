## Overview

The Account Settings block lives on the Account Settings page in your app and allows your users to self-manage their email, password, name, photo, and any other fields you want to let them edit. You can turn on this page by adjusting your settings in [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J). Read more about Utility pages [here](/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/utility-pages/49UoDpTpTPbkoKVwksoqfh).

To edit the Account Settings page and block, click on the Pages menu button, scroll to the Utility pages section, and select the Account Settings page. Once on the page, click anywhere on the page to bring up the block settings.

## Content

The content tab holds a variety of options for you to adjust the Account Settings block:

### **Cover Image**

The Cover Image can be toggled off or on and you can upload a custom cover image to suit the look and feel of your app.

### **Form Fields**

The Form Fields section offers a ton of functionality for controlling what users can edit about their account or profile. The fields above the divider are defaults and cannot be turned off, because they provide critical functionality your app needs to function. However, they do offer several options to customize how they look and function:

* **Avatar**: This field can be disabled completely if no avatar is desired or available for users.

* **Email**: This field can be customized with custom text for everything from the field name itself to allowing users to change their email addresses and the messaging around it. To edit the password reset emails themselves, check out [User Email Notifications](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/user-email-notifications/sZRpewgUkBFFvhKSsQrBx7).

* **Password**: Change the language and labels of the password editing/reset capabilities. Note that users using SSO or Google Sign-in will not be able to change their password here.

* **Name**: Change the placeholder text and control if you want to let users update their name or not.

You can also add custom fields that you want users to be able to change about their profile by clicking on the **Add Field** button. Customize the field type, label, and placeholder like you can on forms, list blocks, or anywhere else in Softr.

### Update Button

Edit the text on the Update button to suit your language or preferred phrasing. Also update the success message to display to the user once the change is confirmed.

## Styles

Click on the Styles tab to change everything from background color, sizing, and rounding to surface/card colors and shadows. Other elements like text color and button color can be changed in your app’s [Theme panel](/styling/7qXYEkNvWQamR6vcLXzZnF/application-theme/91YGSL2aDJajXdbPBhitbc).
