In the Settings tab of your app, you also have the ability to change some optional, but advanced settings for your entire app. You can access these by clicking on the Settings tab on the left, then clicking on Advanced Settings at the very bottom of the list:

## User Caching

When enabled, user data caching improves the speed of your Softr apps by caching user data for 2 minutess to allow for faster list filtering and page loading where logged-in user data is required. We anticipate that updates to user records are less frequent than updates to other records so cache of 2 minutes allows your Softr app to serve up user data much faster. Otherwise, with User Cache off, Softr is forced to get the user’s record each time a page is loaded, regardless of whether any user data has changed. This makes your app slower for no beneficial reason.

If app speed is priority for you, then leave User Caching on. If data freshness is more important and you don’t mind waiting a while on each page load, then turn User Caching off. If you’re wondering which you should choose, we recommend turning User Caching ON for 95% of use cases.

## Allow Embedding

If this is enabled, anyone with the public link to your app can embed the app in another webpage or application. If your app is internal or contains proprietary functionality, it may be best to disable this feature. Try to avoid embedding webpages with multiple iFrames as this can create embeds within embeds. Some instances where this feature may be useful:

* Embed your app in the main landing page of your company website.

* Embed some Softr charts in your primary webpage.

* Embed a list of contacts or resources into a slide deck.

* Embed your SaaS product into a customer’s website.
