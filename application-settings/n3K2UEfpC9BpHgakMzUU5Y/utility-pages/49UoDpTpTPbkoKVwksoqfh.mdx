Utility pages are setup for you automatically, based on the functionality you setup in the [**Authentication**](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) tab of the Users menu. They cannot be deleted, but you can disable certain ones depending on your User Authentication settings. They facilitate core functions of any web app so your users have a great experience and you don’t have to spend time figuring out what to build or how to build it.

While you can change the name and url of these pages in the page settings, we recommend sticking with the defaults. You can also edit the branding of these pages. Each utility page will have its own settings and capabilities. Let’s explore the functions of these pages as they are know by their default names:

* **Log in** - This page is to let your app users log in to your app. You can also create multiple login pages, which is helpful for onboarding different roles or branding them in different ways. It is only available in your app if Login is enabled in your User Authentication settings.

You can also create multiple signup pages, which is helpful for onboarding different roles or branding them in different ways.It is only available in your app if Signup is enabled in your User Authentication settings.

* [Onboarding Flow](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/onboarding-flow/5MmuwRtpDR2JL56SooLXgo) - The onboarding flow pages allow you to build custom user onboarding steps or flows that new users can go into based on things like their user group, email domain, etc. You can setup flows to route people to different pages, ask them to complete their profile, or even create their company page before getting deeper into the app.
