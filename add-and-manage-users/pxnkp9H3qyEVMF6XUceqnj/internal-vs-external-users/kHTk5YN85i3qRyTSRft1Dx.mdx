<Warning>

Note that the Internal/External User distinction is only applicable to legacy [V3 pricing plans](https://www.softr.io/pricing-v3) available before August 13, 2024. [Current V4 pricing](https://softr.io/pricing) plans do not distinguish between internal and external users. For more information, please see [this blog article](https://www.softr.io/blog/pricing-updates-2024).

</Warning>
<Note>Maximum number of internal and external users allowed for a given app depends on the subscription plan. See V3 pricing [plan comparison](https://www.softr.io/pricing). </Note>

## Internal vs. external users

When you [Add users to a Softr app](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/add-users-to-a-softr-app/kBJGPeH635j7HDW4NYoDDs) they will be identified as internal or external users. **Internal** users are those who meet **any** of these criteria:

* They share the same email domain as any of the [collaborators in the workspace](/workspace-and-billing/jZP6yaeXMiJCuB6HhS4xKd/workspaces-and-applications/kTbEWSYXhBCbtTB4K9dpKs), including the workspace owner.

* Their email domain is whitelisted in the domain-based signup.

**External users** are those who don't meet any of the above criteria.

## Examples

Consider an [internal tool](/how-to-guides/ioi5BbuQ2RDM7aHPrpXnjG/what-internal-tools-can-you-build-with-softr/6DAy3i2YZPSLWV5Xd48ajC) like an applicant tracking system for company "XYZ".

* Head of HR (joanne@xyz.com) is added as a workspace collaborator to work on the application. If she’s also added to your app as a user, she’s considered an **internal user**

* HR managers like james@xyz.com invited as users to your application, are also **internal users**, because they share the company's email domain xyz.com.

* Applicants added as users to your app with different email domains are considered **external users**.

In another scenario, for an [employee directory](https://www.softr.io/templates/employee-directory) at company "YZX", only employees with the whitelisted "yzx" email domain can sign up. This makes them **internal users**.
