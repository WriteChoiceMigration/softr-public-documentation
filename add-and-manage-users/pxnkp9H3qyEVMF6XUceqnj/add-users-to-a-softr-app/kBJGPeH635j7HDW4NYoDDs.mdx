## Create users

You can add users to a Softr app in many different ways:

* Create a public [signup form](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signup-form/tPe3uxmdcUNeFYuaLTR1o9)

* [Add users manually in Users tab](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/add-or-import-users-manually/g5R1bGnBTFJ3sWLR8Mgdng)

* [Sync with an external data source](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9)

* Create users via [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/softr/integrations) or API

Depending on the application, one option might be preferable to the others. For instance:

* If you're building a member community that anyone can join, you’d want to have a public signup page.

* If you run an [internal tool](https://www.softr.io/internal-tool) for your company, you’d want to add users manually.

## Sign-in (authentication) methods

You can let users sign in to a Softr app using any of the following methods.

<Tip>Avoid mixing multiple sign-in methods within the same application.</Tip>

### Sign in with email & password

The most standard option. Users can log into an app using their email and password.

### **Sign in with email code**

[This option](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signin-with-email-code/5Ab4ZFWG788NHL2AB6zt2f) lets your users enter their email and get a one-time code to access your app.

### Sign in with m**agic Link**

Magic link is a URL with a unique token that will allow a user to log in by simply clicking on the link or entering it in the browser address bar.

### Sign in with Google

Allow users to sign in with Google.

### **SAML Single Sign-On**

SAML is an open standard that allows different third-party services (Identity Providers) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (including your Softr app), so that users can use a single set of credentials to log into different service providers. You can learn more about single sign-on and how to set it up for your Softr app [here](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/saml-single-sign-on/j9hELMUfGtAGqoNzejgoif).

### **OpenID Single Sign-On**

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/) is an open authentication protocol that extends the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol, adding an identity layer to it. OpenId is utilized by numerous services, and Softr currently supports the [Outseta](https://www.outseta.com/) membership software (**more options available soon**). [Here](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/openid-single-sign-on/hqqStep7RUmiSMb6qnGLkq), you can learn how to integrate Outseta with Softr to allow your users log into your Softr app with their Outseta credentials.
