We take the security of your Softr application very seriously and are committed to providing a fully secure no-code platform.

We have implemented a few levels of security, all being performed server side (many alternatives do client-side hiding only), giving no chance to modify queries on the client side and access more data than the system is configured to expose.

These measures include:

* Dynamically evaluating on the server side which user belongs to which user groups.

* Dynamically evaluating block and page visibility rules on the server side and rendering them only when the current user is eligible to see the pages and blocks.

* Dynamically evaluating data conditional filters on the server side and retrieving only the records that the current user is eligible to see.

* Working only with the tables and fields that have been configured within blocks.

* Working with your datasource via API and short-term caching, hence avoiding creating yet another copy of your data

<Info>Communication between the server side and [data sources](/4230abecf813402aa2926466c313290a?pvs=25) goes via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), ensuring encryption during transfer.</Info>

This being said, apps could be missing configurations, partially configured, or with mistakes that could result in unintentional data exposure. Below we will highlight a few use cases, do’s and don’ts, and implementation details to help you make the best possible security decisions when building your apps and organizing your data.

<Note>Security audit is available for users on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.softr.io/pricing).</Note>

## **Publicly visible pages and blocks**

Suppose an app creator creates a VC portal to showcase their portfolio companies publicly. They will create a publicly visible page with a list block connected to an Airtable/Gsheet table containing the list of companies.

**Do’s**

* Share data publicly only after careful consideration; publicly shared data is public and could be scrapped by anyone.

* Make your datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) contain only publicly shareable data.

**Don’ts**

* Use Airtable views and Gsheet filters as security measures.

* Store non-publicly shareable data in the same table as publicly shareable data.

* Use Softr block’s item per page as a security measure.

## **Member-only visible pages and blocks**

Suppose an app creator creates a VC portal to list member-only perks. They will create a page visible to logged-in users only (members) with a list block visible to logged-in users only (members) connected to an Airtable/Gsheet table containing the list of perks.

**Do’s**

* Add page or block visibility for logged-in users and, if needed, add visibility for custom user groups.

* Make your datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) contain member-only data.

* Test the system with logged-in and non-logged-in users, and check what you can see before you publish your app to live.

**Don’ts**

* Use a signup block if outside members shouldn’t signup and access the data.

* Put the gated content on the page and block which are visible to all users.

* Use Airtable views and Gsheet filters as security measures.

* Use Softr block’s item per page as a security measure.

* Store non-member/publicly shareable data in the same datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) as member-only data

## **Role-only visible pages and blocks**

Suppose an app creator creates a VC portal that allows scouts to submit deals and lets VCs view a list of potential deals.

The creator will create two user groups for each role: **Scouts and VCs.** They will then create a page exclusively visible to Scouts, including a Form block for submitting data to Airtable/Gsheet, also visible only to Scouts. In addition, the creator will create a page and list block visible only to VCs, which will be connected to an Airtable/Gsheet table containing the list of deals submitted via the form above.

**Do’s**

* Create custom user groups and add a page or block visibility for custom user groups.

* Make your datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) contain custom group specific data.

* Test the system with logged-in and non logged-in users, with users from each user group, and check what you can see before you publish your app to live.

**Don’ts**

* Use a signup block if outside members shouldn’t signup and access the data.

* Put the gated content on the page and block which are visible to all users.

* Use Airtable views and Gsheet filters as security measures.

* Use Softr block’s item per page as a security measure.

* Store non-member/publicly shareable data in the same datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) as member-only and custom group specific data

## **Record ownership**

Suppose an app creator creates the same portal and scenario as above and, in addition, creates a page and list block visible only to Scouts, which will be connected to an Airtable/Gsheet table containing the list of deals submitted via the form above and will be showing only deals submitted by logged in scout.

**Do’s**

* Create custom user groups and add a page or block visibility for custom user groups.

* Create a conditional filter on the list and list detail blocks where the record’s attribute, e.g., email is the same as the logged-in user's attribute, e.g., email.

* Make your datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) contain custom group specific data.

* Test the system with logged-in and non logged-in users, with users from each user group, and check what you can see before you publish your app to live.

**Don’ts**

* Use a signup block if outside members shouldn’t signup and access the data.

* Put the gated content on the page and block which are visible to all users.

* Use Airtable views and Gsheet filters as security measures.

* Use Softr block’s item per page as a security measure.

* Store non-member/publicly shareable data in the same datasource table (Airtable, Gsheet, ….) as member-only and custom group specific data

<Tip>Note that Softr viability checks and record conditional filters are applied on the server side, and there is no way to trick the system.</Tip>

We are constantly working on improving the security of Softr systems and are very committed to creating The Easiest yet most Powerful and Secure no-code platform.
