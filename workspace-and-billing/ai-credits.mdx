## Overview

AI credits are what power Softrâ€™s AI features like **Ask AI** and **Database AI Agents**. Credits are consumed based on the model, task type, and size of the input/output. This article explains how credits work, what happens if you run out, and how to add more.

### Included Credits

Every Softr plan â€” **including Free** â€” comes with a set number of AI credits each month.

* Free plan: 500 AI credits/month

* Basic plan: 1000 AI credits/month

* Professional plan: 5000 AI credits/month

* Business: 10,000 AI credits/month

Notes:

* Credits reset automatically each month.

* All AI features draw from the same monthly pool.

* The exact number of included credits depends on your plan.

### Add-on Credits

If you need more AI credits than whatâ€™s included in your plan:

* **Credit add-ons** are available on paid plans.

* Add-ons are billed as subscriptions (not one-time purchases).

* Unused add-on credits can **roll over for up to 1 month**.

* Free credits do not roll over â€” they reset each month.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: If you purchase a 10,000 credit add-on in October but only use 6,000, the remaining 4,000 will carry over into November.

\*Note: Add-on AI credits are only available on new Softr plans (not legacy plans)

### When Credits Run Out

If you run out of AI credits during the month:

* AI features will pause (you wonâ€™t be charged)

* Theyâ€™ll automatically resume when your credits renew at the start of your billing cycle OR you can purchase a credit add-on subscription to continue using AI right away.

### Tracking Credit Usage

You can always see your credit balance and manage add-ons from your **Plans & Billing** page:

1. Go to **Account Settings â†’ Plan and billing**.

2. Check your remaining AI credits under **AI credits**

3. Click **Get more** to purchase a credit add-on.
