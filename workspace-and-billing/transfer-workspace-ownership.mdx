## When might it make sense to do this?

There are a few scenarios when you might want to change the workspace owner:

* When the owner of the workspace leaves your company

* You need another department to take over workspace ownership

* You need to hand-off workspace ownership to a client

* You’re using an old email that you no longer have access to or no longer exists.

<Tip>You must be the current workspace owner in order to do this.</Tip>

<Tip>
Workspaces ownership cannot be transferred while on a trial and at least one user must be on a paid plan.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Workspace Collaborator settings">
    In your Softr dashboard, click on your Workspace in the lower left of the screen and choose Collaborators.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the new account owner as a collaborator, if needed.">
    If the new account owner is not a collaborator to the workspace already, you can invite them to the workspace.
    <Tip>Note that guest collaborators on individual apps cannot be made workspace owners, only full collaborators can.</Tip>
    <Tip>A user must accept the invitation to be a collaborator before they can be made workspace owner.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the warnings and confirm the change">
    A popup will appear reminding you about the current billing information that is used on the account. Note that once the ownership is transferred, only the new owner will have access to billing and plan information. To confirm, you’ll need to type out “**transfer ownership”** and click Confirm to make it final.
