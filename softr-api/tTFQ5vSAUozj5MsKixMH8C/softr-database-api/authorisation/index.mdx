For making calls you need 2 elements:

- API Basic URL: `https://tables-api.softr.io/api/v1`

- Public API Token - [Obtain here](https://docs.softr.io/softr-api/tTFQ5vSAUozj5MsKixMH8C/api-setup-and-endpoints/j1PrTZxt7pv3iZCnZ5Fp19)

To make a call you combine them into an HTTP request. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://tables-api.softr.io/api/v1/databases' \
  -H 'Softr-Api-Key: <TOKEN>'
```

- All API requests must be authenticated and made through HTTPS.

- We currently support using personal access tokens (a.k.a. API Key). OAuth access tokens will be supported later.

- API Key inherits the access rights of the account of the user who grants access. Later more granular scopes and multiple Keys (Tokens) with different scopes may be supported.
