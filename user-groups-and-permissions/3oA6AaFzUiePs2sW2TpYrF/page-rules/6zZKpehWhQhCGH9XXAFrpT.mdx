## Benefits of using Page Rules

With Page Rules, you can use your defined [User Groups](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/user-groups/6XQfKMeKHUvBcAjKvLs3g3) to route users to different pages based on which user group(s) they are a part of. This is helpful when you need to control the flow of users through your app. When combined with block level visibility, Page Rules allow for complex user onboarding flows, user approval processes, and even subscriber page routing.

## How do I use Page Rules?

To access Page Rules, click on the Page Tab, then click on the Pages Rules button.

On the Page Rules screen, you have several options to configure, depending on your number of users groups.

1. You’ll see all of your User Groups listed. You can think of **Logged-in User** as a fallback rule for any user that does not fit into a user group. If a user falls into multiple user groups, the groups at the top of the list take precedence. You can think of the list of group as a heirarchy and adjust them in the stack by dragging and dropping the handle to the left of the user group’s name.

2. Depending on what the user is doing, you can define the page they are taken to based on these columns - After sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out. For pages users are not allowed to see, they will always be taken to the [Permission Denied Utility page](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/permission-denied-401/54HYs3JEk1EoiwpFbPzVSF).

3. In each dropdown, you can choose which page the user should be taken to after the action in the column. By default, all user actions take them to the Home Page.

## **Which signin/signup options are supported?**

As of now, the user group redirects are applied to all the signin/signup options **apart from the following ones:**

* [SAML Single SIgn-On](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/saml-single-sign-on/j9hELMUfGtAGqoNzejgoif)
