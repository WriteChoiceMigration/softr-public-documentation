Page visibility can be used when you want to restrict a certain page to just **Logged in users** or just **Non Logged in users.** It is configured in [Page Settings](/0392ff65acfe4b1c96923c1aac7982f7) => **Visibility** and has the following options:

* **All users** (selected by default)

* **Logged in users**

* **Non Logged in users**

This functionality can be used to have gated content on your Softr app, allowing only logged in users to view specific pages. [Here](/how-to-guides/ioi5BbuQ2RDM7aHPrpXnjG/how-to-create-a-membership-site/diSie6ZE72tDDvrfBkmcmm), we've shown how it can be used to make the page with online courses accessible to logged in users only.

<Tip>Please, keep in mind that gated content (e.g. pages that are only accessible to logged-in users or a specific group of users) will not be crawled by search engines.</Tip>

## Custom User Groups

The **User Groups** settings for the page are similar to [that of the block](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/user-groups/6XQfKMeKHUvBcAjKvLs3g3) but allow setting access for the whole page.
