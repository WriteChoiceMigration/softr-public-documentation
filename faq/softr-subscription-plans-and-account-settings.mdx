   <Accordion title="Do I also need to have Airtable subscription to use Softr?">
Not necessarily. The Airtable free plan has a 1200 row limit per base and, if you are not going to need more than that, the free plan should work fine.
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="If I cancel my paid subscription, will my site stay active?">
Yes, your site will stay the same (including paid features). You'll just switch to Free plan and won't be able to add new paid features.
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="What will happen if I use Starter/Pro plan for a month and then upgrade?">
Please note that the remaining amount will be used as a balance and then you will pay the delta only.
