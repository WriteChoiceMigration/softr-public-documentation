   <Accordion title="Custom domain can’t be connected. What should I do?">
Apart from the steps described [here](/publishing/9qTmU2Lj8Gnpr1Ue6dEAkX/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-app/93K5bLJN3n91MRo9uRGdAf), there are cases when the custom domain is not working because the app has not been published.
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="How to add one more custom domain?">
Currently, each subscription plan provided a limited number of custom domain slots (3 for the Business plan). However, we are able to provide additional domain slots upon request.
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="When setting up a custom domain, the 'this site can't provide a secure connection' message appears. How to solve it?">
