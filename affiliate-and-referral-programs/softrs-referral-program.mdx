Softr users can invite friends and colleagues to join Softr with their personal referral link.

For each signup that turns into a paying customer, the referrer will receive a $25 reward.

The reward can be easily claimed by registering on Partnerstack’s platform.

A Softr user is considered a paying customer when they actually spent money to be on one of Softr’s paid plans.
