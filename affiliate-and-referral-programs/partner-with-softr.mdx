## Requirements

### Applying to be a Softr Expert

**How to submit an application**

To become a Softr Expert, here’s what you’ll need to have ready to prove your qualifications.

* **Relevant information:** Detailsabout you/your business (name, location, contact info, etc.), services provided, specializations, etc.

* **2 client work examples:** You must have a minimum of two high quality client projects completed using Softr

* Completed **Softr certification exam (link to certification page)**

**How to prepare client work examples**

The apps you submit should showcase your best work by ensuring they include integrations, login/signup functionality, and excellent design.

1. **Ask for permission from your client**\
   Always get your client’s permission before submitting their app as an example. Emphasize that this will only be shared with the internal Softr team, not the public.

2. **Create a test user or test account if possible**\
   To avoid displaying personal or private company info, create some temporary sample data to show off inside the app. For publicly accessible apps, this may not be necessary.

3. **Record a walkthrough video**\
   Use Loom or your preferred screen recorder to make a video walkthrough of your app. Explain how it works, the different user roles, and the problems it solves for your client. Show us the backend if possible, and explain any automations you’ve set up.

4. **Prepare screenshots of the app (optional)**\
   You can also upload redacted screenshots of the app to show portions containing sensitive data or areas where you can’t create sample data.

If you are accepted into the Experts Program, you can also add apps to your public portfolio for potential clients to see and test out for themselves.

**Review process**

Once we receive your application, we’ll review and respond with a decision within one month of your submission. We’ll verify your certification, evaluate your client work examples, and check references as needed.
   <Accordion title="Common reasons for rejection to the program">
      - Poor feedback from references or no references listed.

      - Lack of certification certificate

      - Lack of project apps or walkthrough videos

      - Project apps still use default images, copy, etc.

      - Project apps that don’t use login functionality (i.e. only websites)

   </Accordion>

**Acceptance**

Once certified, new partners are officially welcomed into the program.

## **Program Conditions**

**Accurate representation:** We expect our partners to represent Softr accurately and professionally.

To support you, we provide resources to help you position and sell Softr correctly, and to stay up-to-date on the newest capabilities, how we compare to competitors, and more.

**Professionalism:** While constructive feedback and honest opinions are welcome, any public statements that are unprofessional or inappropriate may lead to removal from the program at our discretion.
