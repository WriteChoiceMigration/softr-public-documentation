### **What is Softr Universe?**

Softr Universe is a place where you can discover, share, and celebrate applications created by Softr users. It’s the perfect place to showcase your work, inspire other builders, and show the world what’s possible with Softr.

---

### **Is this a marketplace?**

Not right now. Softr Universe is for sharing applications only.

In the future, we plan to bring templates back — including the ability to submit, share and even sell them — but this is not available yet.

---

### **Who can submit an application?**

Anyone!

---

### **What are the approval criteria?**

We’re looking for applications that:

* Solve real problems for businesses (e.g. internal apps, portals, or tools).

* Are functional, tested, and free of obvious errors.

* Provide enough context for others to understand how they work. For internal apps, this means including screenshots or videos if the app isn’t publicly accessible.

* Have a clean, professional user experience (easy to navigate, intuitive actions).

* Feature a strong UI design — apps should look polished, visually consistent, and appealing.

* Follow good practices for user permissions and security.

* Do not contain offensive or illegal content.

Generally, we’re looking for **great-looking, problem-solving apps** that demonstrate what’s possible with Softr. MVPs or simple landing pages will not be prioritized.

---

### **What is the submission and review process?**

* Submissions are reviewed within **1 month**.

* You will **only be notified if your app is accepted**.

* You may **resubmit once per month** if you’ve updated your app and want it reconsidered.

* Only **one submission per application** is allowed.

* We prioritize **one accepted app per creator**, but may allow multiple if each represents a standout use case.

---

### **Promotion and usage rights**

By submitting your application to Softr Universe, you agree that if accepted, Softr may showcase and promote it across our marketing channels — including our website, blog, newsletter, social media, and beyond.

### **How do I submit my application?**
