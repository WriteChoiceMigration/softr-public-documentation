Core to any app experience is the ability to explore and easily see content. Pages and Navigation are how you can do that in Softr. Pages make up your app and navigation is how your users will access those pages.

Pages and navigation work hand-in-hand to create a seamless experience for the users of your Softr app. Any pages that you create in your app, whether they be application pages or utility pages, can be placed in any Navigation block so your users can quickly and easily access the pages and resources they need.

## Pages

You can view, create, and organize pages in the Pages menu of Softr Studio. Pages are made up of building elements called Blocks and can be customized to control who can see the page, what the page shows, how users access it, and a whole host of other settings. In most cases, you’ll want to create some pages before creating navigation. For more information about pages, check out our [Pages](/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/page-settings/49UoDpTpTPJe69RafDsALq) help article.

### Page Types

* **Application Pages:** These are highly configurable pages that you can add, edit, delete, and customize to suit your brand and specific app functionality. You can add blocks of all kinds and control other settings such as SEO and page slug.

* [**Utility Pages**](https://docs.softr.io/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/utility-pages/49UoDpTpTPbkoKVwksoqfh): These pages are created and removed for you depending on your [Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) settings. Softr automatically bootstraps pages like login, signup, account settings, 404, 401, etc for you so you can focus on styling them as needed.

## Navigation

To make it easier for users to get around inside your app, you can create Navigation. Users can use Navigation to easily click around from page to page, regardless of the device they’re on. Any pages you create will be available to add in Navigation as either links or buttons. It’s also completely responsive to screen size! For more information about Navigation, check out our [Navigation](/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/navigation-settings/49UoDpTpTMxcBVDnRVTncV) help article.

## Footer

Much like navigation, you can create footers for your apps and apply them to individual pages, based on your needs. You can customize the function, styling, and much more on the footers in your app. Learn more about how to manage, create, and edit footers in our doc about [Footer Settings](/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/footer-settings/4woAqVC4dTDN5429FkKuu7).

## Page and Navigation Visibility

You can change the visibility of certain links and buttons on the navigation and footer, thus defining which users can see and access certain pages. Hover over any link or button in your navigation to show the conditional visibility button. This is separate from [Page Visibility](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/page-visibility/nWJaN689VKA1TUeaEfzK9u).

## Use Cases

### Client Portal

A client portal app might have pages called Project, Team, and Invoices, with some Navigation with links or buttons to those pages. You could even limit who can see which pages based on whether they are clients or employees.

### Reporting Dashboard

A reporting dashboard might only have a single page, where no navigation is needed at all - especially if it’s a public dashboard that doesn’t require a viewer to log in.

### SaaS Platform

A SaaS platform might have all kinds of pages with different Navigational views and footers for each type of user. For instance, a customer might need to see their dashboard, but a SaaS employee might need to see usage analytics reports. With pages and navigation, you can build this with ease.
