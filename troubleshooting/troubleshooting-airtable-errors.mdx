When using Airtable as your data source, you may run across some errors. In this article we help you to troubleshoot the most common error cases related to Airtable.

## Invalid Airtable key

### API key for Airtable account ‘\{account_name}’ is no longer valid

Invalid Airtable key error can be caused by:

Start by making sure there is an Airtable key added to your app by going to App Settings > Data Sources.

If there is an Airtable key used in the the app, make sure the connected Airtable key is still valid. To do this you can find your Airtable API key in your Airtable account overview.
