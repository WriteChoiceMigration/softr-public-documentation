Using HubSpot as a data source can sometimes result in errors. This guide will help you troubleshoot one of the most common issues.

### **Too Many Search or Filter Conditions**

This error occurs when too many search fields or filter conditions are applied to a block. The HubSpot API has specific limits on `AND` and `OR` filters in a query:

* **Up to 5 "AND" filter groups** can be used.

* Each "AND" group can contain **up to 6 "OR" filters**.

* The total number of filters across all groups must not exceed **18 filters per block**.

Additionally, there is a stricter limit for blocks with Edit button: you can only use **up to 4 "AND" filters** in these cases.

**How to Fix It**

To resolve this error, try reducing the number of conditions applied in these areas:

* **Conditional filters**

* **Inline search & filter**

* **Action button visibility filters**

By simplifying the filters in your setup, you can bring the total within the allowed limits and avoid this error.
