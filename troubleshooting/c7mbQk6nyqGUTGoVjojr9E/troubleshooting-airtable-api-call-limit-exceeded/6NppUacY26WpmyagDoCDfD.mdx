If you're facing issues with Airtable API call limits being exceeded, follow these 3 steps to identify the problem and find the right solution.

### **Step 1 â€“ Understand Your Plan's API Call Limits**

Review your Airtable plan and associated API call limits:

* **Free Plan:** 1000 API calls per month

* **Team Plan:** 100,000 API calls per month

* **Business Plan:** Unlimited API calls per month

* **Enterprise Plan:** Not disclosed publicly

Check your Airtable plan next to the name of the workspace:

<Note>Make sure your connected Airtable base is actually in theworkspace you are reviewing, and that the workspace is a **paid one**.</Note>

If you exceed the limit within a month, your API access will keep working and your **rate limit will be reduced** for the remainder of the month, returning to normal at month-end â€“ rate limiting is described later on this page.

**Important:**

* API call limits are applied **per Airtable workspace** â€“ regardless of seats, the monthly API limit remains the same.

* There is a **shared API calls quota** â€“ across all integrations in a workspace, meaning third-party tools and multiple Softr apps, share the same request limits.

* [Airtable Pricing](https://airtable.com/pricing)

### **Step 2 â€“ Check if you are hitting the rate limit**

Airtable imposes a **rate limit** of **5 requests per second** for OAuth Connections to ensure optimal user performance across all pricing tiers. Softr uses an OAuth connection by default, however you can also use Airtable PATs, which have a higher rate limit (read solutions in Step 3 below). If a monthly API calls limit exceeds, depending on the [Airtable price tier](https://airtable.com/pricing):

* **Free Plan:** rate limit will decrease to 2 requests per second until the month ends

* **Team Plan:** rate limit will decrease to 2 requests per second until the month ends

* **Business Plan:** rate limit will maintain 5 requests per second

* **Enterprise Plan:** rate limit will maintain 5 requests per second

<Note>Choose a higher-tiered plan, such as the Business or Enterprise Plan, to ensure a consistently fast experience throughout the month.</Note>

### Step 3 â€“ Find p**otential solutions:**

* You can always switch over to using Softrâ€™s own databases, which are much faster and performant than Airtableâ€™s. We even have an import from Airtable option that you can use to quickly move your Airtable data over to [Softr Databases](/softr-databases/57RHfyrVrq5xPojyELRnSu).

* You can switch the datasource connection method in Softr from OAuth (5 requests per second) to use Airtableâ€™s new Personal Access Tokens, which have a rate limit of 50 requests per second. [Learn more about that here](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/airtable/jHX7kfH7QvkVcELQvS3VoX#using-airtable-personal-access-tokens-with-softr).

* In the event that you still encounter issues when using a PAT, trying using multiple PATs for different blocks or apps to distribute the request load.

* Weâ€™re doing our best to not exceed Airtableâ€™s rate limiting. You can also keep your pages slim, not exceeding around 5 dynamic blocks per page.

* Isolate Airtable bases that consume many API calls into separate Airtable workspaces to balance API call limits.

* When possible, try using the unique Softr App {"<>"} Airtable Workspace {"<>"} Airtable Base combination.

* Instead of creating separate Airtable connections for your Softr apps, reuse the existing ones in your Softr workspace. Aim to consistently use one "My Airtable Connection (usrXXXX) #1" across all applications per Softr workspace. Only generate a new connection when dealing with new Airtable user accounts or workspaces.

* Upgrade to a higher Airtable plan. This will not affect your Softrâ€™s [flat-rate pricing](http://softr.io/pricing). Each Softr plan comes with a **set of user allowances designed for a company size**:
  + The number of users you have in Softr does not affect your Airtable bill.
  + Your teammates also donâ€™t need an Airtable license to be added as users in your Softr app.
