monday.com is like a spreadsheet database and work management system that can also act as a relational database. As a result, it is a more robust data management option than simple spreadsheet solutions.

This integration allows you to:

* give your clients real-time project visibility

* collect information faster

* create user-friendly dashboards without board limits

<Info>monday.com is available on **Professional** and higher plans.</Info>

## **1. Connect your monday.com account**

To use monday.com in Softr, you must first **connect your monday.com account**. Any monday.com account you connect in Softr can be used by all of the workspace's collaborators in all of the workspace’s apps.

<Warning>

To connect your monday.com data to Softr you will need **admin** access in your monday.com workspace.

</Warning>

### **Step 1: Get your API token**

* Go to **Administration** > **Connections** > [API in monday.com.](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/authentication#admin-tab)

* Copy your **Personal API Token**.

## **2. Connect your monday.com data to your Softr app**

Once your monday.com account is connected, you can use it in any Softr application.

### **Step 1: Connect your data to a dynamic block**

To display your data in the app, connect a [dynamic block](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/visualize-data-with-building-blocks/41p6U2eZs7zgY8zWmFV4eH#1859a723d691803d9551ecd7b3b0c043) (e.g. [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU), [Grid](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/grid-block/42JZoeYwMsogZcveqh74QH), [Table](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe)) to your monday.com board:

1. Go to the Block **Source** **tab** and select your monday.com integration.

2. Select the **workspace** you want to connect.

3. Pick the **board** you want to use.

<Warning>

**Important:** You can connect **only one board to one block**. For example, if you want to show a list of clients, you can select the **Companies** board. If you would like to show **Tickets**, you will need to add another **dynamic block.**
</Warning>

### **Step 2: Map monday.com columns to item fields**

When you connect your board to a block, you can choose which monday.com **columns** to display and map it to a Softr field. This lets you control how your monday.com data appears in Softr.

**Example:** If your Airtable base has a **Profile Picture (Attachment field)**, map it to an **Image field** in Softr so it displays correctly

You can learn more about Softr field types in the [List block overview](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU).

### **Supported fields**

Most fields you edit in monday **monday.com** can be edited in Softr, but there are some exceptions:

* **Read-Only Fields:** Some fields can be displayed but **not edited**, including:
  + **Created by**
  + **Created at**
  + **Last updated**
  + **Item ID**
  + **Mirror fields**

<Warning>Currently Formula fields, Progress fields, and Workdocs are not supported.</Warning>

### **Connected boards in monday.com**

Connected Boards let you link data between different boards, making **monday.com a relational database**.

For example, if you have two boards:

* **Clients**

* **Projects**

You can **connect Clients to Projects** to see which projects each client is involved in. This helps keep all related information in one place.
<Frame caption="monday.com Projects board with a Connected board with Clients.">![monday.com Projects board with a Connected board with Clients.](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F484adde5-19ba-4c92-b797-4cbdd4ad462b%2Fe8f3fd2b-c6cf-44ab-b11c-a5c7e8fb5c46%2FUntitled.png&blockId=1ac9a723-d691-802f-9f53-c04d6fdb2402&projectId=1032)</Frame>

Below, you can see the Clients table, where the Project field is a Connected board that shows records from the Projects table.

### Subitems

[Subitems](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011905480-All-about-subitems) in monday.com help you add extra layers of information to your board items. You can sync these subitems to your Softr application as a [Linked List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/linked-list/bWjTdKhbftofSEKRSxMFz9).

To do this, ensure you have a page with your Items mapped to any Dynamic [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU) block, along with a corresponding [List Detail](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/item-details-block-/4bE8XaFbJp45wkAwuWiz8f) page mapped to the same board.

When you add a List block to this page, you’ll have the option to display either **Items** or **Subitems**.

If you choose **Subitems**, only the sub-items will be shown, automatically filtered based on the parent task details in the view. (This filtering applies in both the preview and the published app.)

**Limitations**

<Info>

Currently, the **Charts, Inbox, Map, Org Chart,** blocks are not supported. These will be available in future updates.
