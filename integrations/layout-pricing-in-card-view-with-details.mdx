Using this block, you can display the different pricing options of your product or service. You can also link each option to a corresponding checkout page (internal or external), which we'll discuss a bit later.
<Frame caption="Pricing in card view with details">![Pricing in card view with details](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F584960ba-fc70-4946-86e1-682ee6cb1dff%2Fpricing-card-view-details.png&blockId=eb314ad5-c9d0-4750-9fb7-529debc9dad1&projectId=1032)</Frame>

Let's review the block settings, which are located under the **Features** tab.

## **Title and Subtitle**

Here, you can customize the **Title** and **Subtitle** of the block.

## **Multiple billing cycles**

You can enable this option if, for instance, you want to show different prices for **yearly** and **monthly** billing. Under **Cycle description**, you can add a custom text for your Yearly option.

## **Pricing Tiers**

Here, you add the details for each of your pricing tiers (Title, Yearly and Monthly prices, Features, etc.).

## **Button**

Each tier has a button that can be used to take the users to the checkout page. If you're using a payment service other than Stripe, you can use the **Redirect to url** option under **Add action** to take the users to your external checkout page.

To use the Stripe Checkout option, your first need to [connect your Stripe account](/integrations/etS18kJqm1fuD58KCsjC3z/stripe-checkout/iBomMEucRZtM2y6HuutYVC) to your Softr app.
<Frame caption="Button action options">![Button action options](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9e642407-b38d-431c-a3a9-afda53402122%2Fbutton-action.png&blockId=b9b5697f-9d25-44b4-8cf3-78e8402f5af9&projectId=1032)</Frame>

**So, let's select the Stripe Checkout option and start configuring the checkout settings.**

## **Recurring payments**

Enable this if you want to charge your customers periodically based on a specific schedule (e.g. for a monthly subscription). When configuring a product on Stripe, you have the option to set it as **One time** or **Recurring**.
<Frame caption="Choosing a product type on Stripe">![Choosing a product type on Stripe](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F821be2c2-5f8b-4ed2-9f57-67ffe9240816%2Fchoosing-product-type-stripe.png&blockId=c67a2555-ec3e-405f-a7fe-9e80f08787a9&projectId=1032)</Frame>

## **Allow promotion codes**

Here, you need to choose if you're going to accept [promotion codes](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/coupons/codes) on your Stripe checkout.

## **Enable automatic tax**

You can select to apply automatic taxes on checkout, which needs to be configured on Stripe.

### **Adding the Tax feature on Stripe**

First of all, if you don't have the Tax feature enabled on Stripe, you can add it from the Features and Products list as shown below.
<Frame caption="Adding the Tax feature">![Adding the Tax feature](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F5af9b45b-5ee4-47d7-b52d-69a8589d3fbf%2Fadding-tax-feature.png&blockId=9f2150bc-6086-41f8-8b18-2a088175843f&projectId=1032)</Frame>

Now, the Tax settings will become available from your Stripe settings.

### **Configuring tax settings**

Further on, you need to configure your tax settings, setting up **Default product tax category**, **Tax registration locations**, and others.

### **Testing taxes**

That's it. Now when you create a new product (or edit an existing one) on Stripe, taxes will be applied automatically for your selected locations based on the **Product tax category**.
<Frame caption="Creating a product">![Creating a product](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F66c1db11-8418-4d4a-8190-3a1430694a39%2Fcreating-product.png&blockId=da4ed366-11de-4efb-8a77-2975db1ed927&projectId=1032)</Frame>

Let's also see what this looks like from the perspective of your Softr app users.
<Frame caption="User checkout">![User checkout](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fbe82f2a7-b993-4a2b-a768-54688fb17a9d%2Fuser-checkout.gif&blockId=4a78f1e2-eded-4acc-8c88-2994c08b62ad&projectId=1032)</Frame>

## **Plan IDs and Success/Cancel URL**

Now you just need to configure each plan corresponding to your Stripe products. If you have multiple billing cycles, you need to configure "**Monthly Plan"** & "**Yearly Plan"** fields in Softr. In case of a single billing cycle, you will configure only one **"Plan"** field.
<Frame caption="Plan IDs and Success/Cancel URLs">![Plan IDs and Success/Cancel URLs](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F40d19125-7296-4e84-bcc6-c6ee87d7fe76%2Fplan-ids.png&blockId=e4b18372-9abf-47d5-a0e4-877a4686e3ff&projectId=1032)</Frame>

You can find the **Monthly/Yearly Plan ID** by navigating to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/). On the dashboard, open **Products Menu**, select a specific product, and choose the corresponding Plan ID from the Pricing plans list. In case your Products list or Pricing list is empty, please make sure to follow the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription#without-code) to create Products & Plans first.

And finally, you need to fill out **"Success Url"** and **"Error Url"** fields, which show correspondingly where will customers be redirected upon completion (or cancellation/error scenario) of the checkout process.

<Tip>The **"Success Url"** and **"Error Url"** fields are mandatory and Stripe checkout won't work if they are empty or don't start with either http:// or https://.</Tip>
