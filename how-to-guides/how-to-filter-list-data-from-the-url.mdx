This is a handy feature if you want your users to be taken to a filtered version of your List via URL. You can filter the list through an **Inline Filter** or **Search**. Let’s consider the Inline Filter case first.

## Filtering the list through an inline filter

To filter the list by one of the Inline Filter values, you need to use the following format: **?filter-by-fieldName=fieldValue**

<Tip>In order for the URL filter to work, you need to have an [Inline Filter](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU) set up for the same field in your list.</Tip>

You should add the filtering parameters at the end of your List URL, replacing **fieldName** with the name of the field you want to use for filtering and **fieldValue** with the value you want to filter by. Let's consider a specific example to make it clear.

### **Example**

Let's say we have a list of employee profiles with a **Position** field and want to have a URL that filters the list, leaving only the profiles where the **Position** is **Engineer**.
<Frame caption="List of employee profiles">![List of employee profiles](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F10262c00-37dd-46ad-b461-2f8c2df884ab%2Flist-employee-profiles.png&blockId=c0ee9db8-a8c1-4e14-aa9b-5b36bd9c8242&projectId=1032)</Frame>

First of all, let's set up a corresponding Inline Filter.

Next, let's configure the URL, which will look as follows:

* https://\{subdomain}.softr.app/list?filter-by-Position=Engineer

<Tip>Note that both **fieldName** and **fieldValue** are case sensitive. For instance, in the current example, the field name should be **"Position"** and not **"position"** or **"POSITION."**</Tip>

That's it. Now, let's check if everything is working correctly.

Testing the filtering

<Tip>If you have a space inside your field name or value, you can replace it with **"%20"**
inside the URL.</Tip>

## Filtering the list through search

To pre-filter the list through search, you need to use the following format: **?search-for=searchValue**

<Tip>In order for the URL parameter to work, you need to have a search bar set up for your list with **Search by** field(s) selected.</Tip>

You should add the parameter at the end of your List URL, replacing **searchValue** with the query you want to filter the list by. Let's consider a specific example to make it clear.

### Example

Let’s say we have a list of tasks for a software development team, where each task has a name.
<Frame caption="A list of tasks">![A list of tasks](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fccddfad8-091e-40a5-8aff-cd77d3c37c14%2Flist-of-tasks.png&blockId=5566afe3-80fd-4feb-bf08-49277a192f22&projectId=1032)</Frame>

So, if we add the following parameter at the end of our page URL, we will see a list that only contains entries with a value “merge”: **?search-for=merge**
<Frame caption="Testing the URL">![Testing the URL](https://media.helpkit.co/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F7ca8f6d8-fba0-467c-907c-218f6a138cee%2FScreen_Recording_2023-06-13_at_15.45.48.gif&blockId=88d57840-ad0f-442b-ae58-3570b457fa17&projectId=1032)</Frame>

## Combining search and inline filters

It’s also possible to combine inline filter and search parameter formats by simply joining them with an “&”: **?filter-by-fieldName=fieldValue&search-for=searchValue**

As a result, only the list records that match **both of the conditions** will be displayed.
